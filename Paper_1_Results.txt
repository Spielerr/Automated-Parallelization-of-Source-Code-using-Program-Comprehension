Only Inter function Parallelism

- Show Map Reduce code stubs, explain the variations wrt array sizes, number of mappers...

Fields to be used in the result tables:
- Number of arrays / mappers / function fn_calls
- Array Sizes

- The above 2 can either be shown in 2 separate tables or as a combination of possibilities

- Sequential time 
- Parallel time

- Speedup as a ratio 

- Hardware Usage:
-- With increasing threads => change number of threads being used
-- Use some profiling
-- How many threads are used?
-- How long a thread is used?
-- How busy are you keeping the available threads
-- To justify "With increase in available hardware. there are improvements in usage of the hardware as well

- Comparison between the two methods explained in our paper 

- Show meaningful graphs for everything
