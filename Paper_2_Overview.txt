Paper 2:
Intra Function Parallelism using Program Comprehension

Intro to Paper:
- How Parallelism is useful
- Concept of Program Comprehension
- Martino
- Related Work
- How our approach is different
- Loop based Parallelism (Pluto)
- Using Program Comprehension as an approach to solve Parallelism

Program Comprehension

Mappings from sequential to parallel algos
- sort
- max
- min 
- mean

add more Mappings

Write our own stubs

Flow charts for Program Comprehension Implementation
Explain:
- Reducing program to AST 
- Path Based Representation of data 
- Code to Vec Model to generate vector embeddings (Similar to Word to Vec)
- K Means Clustering(Modified)
- Training phase and prediction phase
- Threshold concepts
- Other Category (Maintaining semantics and correctness of the original program)
- Mapping program to label
- Dynamic Verification
- Replacing code with parallel equivalent

Results:
- Graphs
- Showing correctness is maintained
- Improvements with hardware (Better utilization of hardware)
